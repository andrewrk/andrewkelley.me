<h1>I Quit My Cushy Job at OkCupid to Live on Donations to Zig</h1>
<p>
I am fortunate to be one of those people who started tinkering with code
in their teens, and then found themselves in the position where their hobby
could not only pay rent, but afford a comfortable standard of living, even
in New York City.
</p>
<p>
For a little over a year now, I worked on the backend team at
<a href="https://www.okcupid.com/">OkCupid</a>, maintaining a large C++
codebase that has not been reworked since 2005 when
<a href="https://twitter.com/maxtaco">Maxwell Krohn</a>
published the original
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/okws:krohn-ms/okws_krohn-ms.pdf">OKWS paper</a>
on which OkCupid is still based.
</p>
<p>
As satisfying as it is to delete dead code, rework abstractions to remove footguns,
and migrate a monolithic codebase to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a>,
my coworkers were well aware that my real passion was spent on nights and weekends,
where I poured all the energy I could muster into <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> -
if not from my incessant comparisons between snippets of C++ code and how it could be
better expressed in Zig, then from the tea mug that my lovely girlfriend Alee got me
as a celebratory gift for reaching
<a href="https://ziglang.org/download/#release-0.1.1">release 0.1.0</a>:

<h2>Zig is Picking Up Steam</h2>
<p>
Ever since I gave this
<a href="https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-andrew-kelley">Software Should be Perfect</a> talk, it seems that the Zig community has seen a steady influx of new members. 
</p>
<img src="https://andrewkelley.me/img/david-zig.jpg" style="width: 200px">
<p>David keeps sending me selfies with this hat that he made.</p>
<p>
The Zig community grew in size so much, that some weekends I found myself
with only enough time to merge pull requests and respond to issues, and no
time leftover to make progress on big roadmap changes.
</p>
<p>
I found this both exciting, and frustrating. Here I was working on legacy code
40 hours per week, while multiple Zig issues needed my attention.
</p>
<p>
And so I took the plunge. I gave up my senior backend software engineer salary,
and will attempt to live on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/andrewrk">Patreon donations</a>.
</p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>Here are some of the bigger items that are coming up now that I have more time:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1023">remove more sigils from the language</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/208">add tuples and remove var args</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/89">self-hosted compiler</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/910">http server and http client based on async/await</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/943">decentralized package manager</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/21">generate html documentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/68">hot code swapping</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I can't wait to make significant progress on these items. That said, I will also
dedicate time each day for bug fixes and writing documentation.
Every weekday except Friday, this will be my wakeup process:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make tea</li>
  <li>Fix a bug</li>
  <li>Write some documentation</li>
  <li>Deal with all open pull requests, whether that is by merging, rejecting, requesting
    changes, or solving the use case a different way.</li>
  <li>Proceed with working on a big feature item.</li>
</ol>
<p>
On Fridays, I will spend the day working on a project other than Zig, but one that
is implemented in Zig. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rewrite <a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/groovebasin">Groove Basin</a> in Zig.</li>
  <li>Work on my <a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/clashos">game that the raspberry pi boots directly into</a> (this explores Zig's ability to be used for embedded and Operating System development) </li>
  <li>Start reworking my <a href="http://genesisdaw.org/">digital audio workstation</a> in Zig.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm beyond excited to get Zig to a place where it can reasonably be used for
high quality and practical software projects. My goal is to make Zig so useful
and practical that people will find themselves using it without intending to.
</p>
<p>And so it comes down to this - will you fund my efforts?
</p>

<h2>Why Donate to Zig?</h2>
<p>
Consider the basic premise of a for-profit business:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Customers pay currency in exchange for goods or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If all goes well, both parties benefit from the exchange. But for-profit
businesses are motivated, at the end of the day, not by customer satisfaction,
but by profit.
</p>
<p>
It's fine, this is how the world works. But it's not how Zig works.
</p>
<p>
Zig is created by the open source community, for the open source community.
One of our main <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Zen">tenants</a>
is</p>
<blockquote>Together we serve end users.</blockquote>
<p>
The Zig project is a public service, entirely motivated by improving the technical
landscape of open source tools. There is no board to please, no stock shareholders
demanding higher quarterly earnings, no office politics or career progressions on
the line. 100% of donations I receive go towards paying rent, buying food, and
generally attempting to live a modest, but healthy life.

<h1>Introduction to the Zig Programming Language</h1>
<p class="lead">
  2016 February 08 (Updated 2019 Feb 02)
</p>
<p>
The past few months I took a break from working on
<a href="http://genesisdaw.org/">Genesis Digital Audio Workstation</a>
to work, instead, on creating a
<a href="https://ziglang.org/">new programming language</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am nothing if not ambitious, and my goal is to create a new programming
language that is <em>more pragmatic than C</em>. This is like to trying to be
more evil than the devil himself.
</p>
<p>
So, in order, these are the priorities of Zig:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Pragmatic</strong>: At the end of the day, all that really matters is
    whether the language helped you do what you were trying to do better than any other
    language.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Optimal</strong>: The most natural way to write a program should result
    in top-of-the-line runtime performance, equivalent to or better than C. In places
    where performance is king, the optimal code should be clearly expressible.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Safe</strong>: Optimality may be sitting in the driver's seat, but
    safety is sitting in the passenger's seat, wearing its seatbelt, and asking nicely
    for the other passengers to do the same.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Readable</strong>: Zig prioritizes reading code over writing it.
    Avoid complicated syntax. Generally there should be a canonical way to do
    everything.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="design-decisions">Design Decisions</h2>
<h3 id="debug-release">Widely Diverging Debug and Release Builds</h3>
<p>
  Zig has the concept of a <em>debug build</em> vs a <em>release build</em>.
  Here is a comparison of priorities for debug mode vs release mode:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th style="width: 44%;">Debug Mode</th>
    <th>Release Mode</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Time Spent Compiling</th>
    <td>
      Code must compile fast. Use all manner of caching, shared objects,
      multithreading, whatever must be done in order to produce a binary
      as soon as possible.
    </td>
    <td>
      Making a release build could take orders of magnitude longer than
      a debug build and that is acceptable.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Runtime Performance</th>
    <td>
      Could be order of magnitude slower than release build and that is
      acceptable.
    </td>
    <td>
      Optimal performance. Aggressive optimizations. Take the time needed
      to produce a highly efficient runtime efficiency. No compromises here.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Undefined Behavior</th>
    <td>
      What <em>would</em> be undefined behavior in a release build, is defined
      behavior in a debug build, and that is for the runtime to trap. That is,
      crash. This includes things like array bounds checking, integer overflow,
      reaching unreachable code. Not all undefined behavior can be caught, but
      a comfortably large amount can.
    </td>
    <td>
      Undefined behavior in release mode has unspecified consequences, and this
      lets the optimizer produce optimal code.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
  The build mode is available to the source code via the expression
  <code>@import("builtin").mode</code>.
</p>
<p>
Note: Since this blog post, Zig has gained <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Build-Mode">two more release modes</a>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Release Safe</li>
  <li>Release Small</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c-abi">Complete C ABI Compatibility</h3>
<p>
Part of being pragmatic is recognizing C's existing success. Interop
with C is crucial. Zig embraces C like the mean older brother who you are a little
afraid of but you still want to like you and be your friend.
</p>
<p>
In Zig, functions look like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">fn doSomething() {
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>
The compiler is free to inline this function, change its parameters,
and otherwise do whatever it wants, since this is an internal function.
However if you decide to export it:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">export fn doSomething() {
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>
Now this function has the C ABI, and the name shows up in the symbol table
verbatim. Likewise, you can declare an external function prototype:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">extern fn puts(s: [*]const u8) c_int;</code></pre>
<p>
In Zig, like in C, you typically do not create a "wrapper" or "bindings" to
a library, you just use it. But if you had to type out or generate all the
extern function prototypes, this would be a binding. That is why Zig has the ability
to parse .h files:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">use @cImport({
    @cInclude("stdio.h");
});</code></pre>
<p>
This exposes all the symbols in stdio.h - including the <code>#define</code> statements -
to the zig program, and then you can call <code>puts</code> or <code>printf</code> just like
you would in C.
</p>
<p>
One of Zig's use cases is
<a href="http://tiehuis.github.io/iterative-replacement-of-c-with-zig">slowly transitioning a large C project to Zig</a>.
Zig can produce simple .o files for linking against other .o files, and it can
also generate .h files based on what you export. So you could write part of your
application in C and part in Zig, link all the .o files together and everything
plays nicely with each other.
</p>
<h3 id="maybe-type">Optional Type Instead of Null Pointer</h3>
<p>
One area that Zig provides safety without compromising efficiency or
readability is with the optional type.
</p>
<p>
The question mark symbolizes the optional type. You can convert a type to an optional
type by putting a question mark in front of it, like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">// normal integer
const normal_int: i32 = 1234;

// optional integer
const optional_int: ?i32 = 5678;</code></pre>
<p>
Now the variable <code>optional_int</code> could be an <code>i32</code>, or <code>null</code>.
</p>
<p>
Instead of integers, let's talk about pointers. Null references are the source of many runtime
exceptions, and even stand accused of being
<a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2015/08/31/the-worst-mistake-of-computer-science/">the worst mistake of computer science</a>.
</p>
<p>Zig does not have them.</p>
<p>
Instead, you can use an optional pointer. This secretly compiles down to a normal pointer,
since we know we can use 0 as the null value for the maybe type. But the compiler
can check your work and make sure you don't assign null to something that can't be null.
</p>
<p>
Typically the downside of not having null is that it makes the code more verbose to
write. But, let's compare some equivalent C code and Zig code.
</p>
<p>
Task: call malloc, if the result is null, return null.
</p>
<p>C code</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// malloc prototype included for reference
void *malloc(size_t size);

struct Foo *do_a_thing(void) {
    char *ptr = malloc(1234);
    if (!ptr) return NULL;
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>Zig code</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">// malloc prototype included for reference
extern fn malloc(size: size_t) ?[*]u8;

fn doAThing() ?*Foo {
    const ptr = malloc(1234) orelse return null;
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>
  Here, Zig is at least as convenient, if not more, than C. And, the type of "ptr"
  is <code>[*]u8</code> <em>not</em> <code>?[*]u8</code>. The <code>orelse</code> operator
  unwrapped the maybe type and therefore <code>ptr</code> is guaranteed to be non-null everywhere
  it is used in the function.
</p>
<p>
  The other form of checking against NULL you might see looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void do_a_thing(struct Foo *foo) {
    // do some stuff

    if (foo) {
        do_something_with_foo(foo);
    }

    // do some stuff
}</code></pre>
<p>
  In Zig you can accomplish the same thing:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">fn doAThing(optional_foo: ?*Foo) {
    // do some stuff

    if (optional_foo) |foo| {
      doSomethingWithFoo(foo);
    }

    // do some stuff
}</code></pre>
<p>
Once again, the notable thing here is that inside the if block,
<code>foo</code> is no longer an optional pointer, it is a pointer, which
cannot be null.
</p>
<p>
One benefit to this is that functions which take pointers as arguments can
be annotated with the "nonnull" attribute - <code>__attribute__((nonnull))</code> in
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.0.0/gcc/Function-Attributes.html">GCC</a>.
The optimizer can sometimes make better decisions knowing that pointer arguments
cannot be null.
</p>
<p>
Note: when this blog post was written, Zig did not distinguish between
Single Item Pointers and Unknown Length Pointers. You can
<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Pointers">read about this in the documentation</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="errors">Errors</h3>
<p>
One of the distinguishing features of Zig is its exception handling strategy.
</p>
<p>
Zig introduces two primitive types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Error Sets</li>
  <li>Error Unions</li>
</ul>
<p>
An error set can be declared like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">const FileOpenError = error {
  FileNotFound,
  OutOfMemory,
  UnexpectedToken,
};</code></pre>
<p>
An error set is a lot like an enum, except errors from different error sets
which share a name, are defined to have the same numerical value. So each
error name has a globally unique integer associated with it. The integer value
0 is reserved.
</p>
<p>
You can refer to these error values with field access syntax, such as
<code>FileOpenError.FileNotFound</code>. There is syntactic sugar for creating an ad-hoc
error set and referring to one of its errors: <code>error.SomethingBroke</code>. This
is equivalent to <code>error{SomethingBroke}.SomethingBroke</code>.
</p>
<p>
In the same way that pointers cannot be null, an error set value is always an error.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">const err = error.FileNotFound;</code></pre>
<p>
Most of the time you will not find yourself using an error set type. Instead,
likely you will be using the error union type. Error unions are created with
the binary operator <code>!</code>, with the error set on the left and any other
type on the right: <code>ErrorSet!OtherType</code>.
</p>
<p>
Here is a function to parse a string into a 64-bit integer:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">const ParseError = error {
    InvalidChar,
    Overflow,
};

pub fn parseU64(buf: []const u8, radix: u8) ParseError!u64 {
    var x: u64 = 0;

    for (buf) |c| {
        const digit = charToDigit(c);

        if (digit &gt;= radix) {
            return error.InvalidChar;
        }

        // x *= radix
        if (@mulWithOverflow(u64, x, radix, &amp;x)) {
            return error.Overflow;
        }

        // x += digit
        if (@addWithOverflow(u64, x, digit, &amp;x)) {
            return error.Overflow;
        }
    }

    return x;
}</code></pre>
<p>
Notice the return type is <code>ParseError!u64</code>. This means that the function
either returns an unsigned 64 bit integer, or one of the <code>ParseError</code> errors.
</p>
<p>
Within the function definition, you can see some return statements that return
an error set value, and at the bottom a return statement that returns a <code>u64</code>.
Both types implicitly cast to <code>ParseError!u64</code>.
</p>
<p>
Note: this blog post was written before Zig had the concept of
<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Error-Set-Type">Error Sets</a> vs
<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#The-Global-Error-Set">anyerror</a>, and
before Zig had <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Inferred-Error-Sets">Error Set Inference</a>.
Most functions in Zig can rely on error set inference, which would make the prototype of <code>parseU64</code> 
look like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">pub fn parseU64(buf: []const u8, radix: u8) !u64 {
    ...</code></pre>
<p>
What it looks like to use this function varies depending on what you're
trying to do. One of the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You want to provide a default value if it returned an error.</li>
  <li>If it returned an error then you want to return the same error.</li>
  <li>You know with complete certainty it will not return an error, so want to unconditionally unwrap it.</li>
  <li>You want to take a different action for each possible error.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to provide a default value, you can use the <code>catch</code> expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">fn doAThing(str: []u8) void {
    const number = parseU64(str, 10) catch 13;
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>
In this code, <code>number</code> will be equal to the successfully parsed string, or
a default value of 13. The type of the right hand side of the <code>catch</code> expression must
match the unwrapped error union type, or of type <code>noreturn</code>.
</p>
<p>Let's say you wanted to return the error if you got one, otherwise continue with the
function logic:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">fn doAThing(str: []u8) !void {
    const number = parseU64(str, 10) catch |err| return err;
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>
  There is a shortcut for this. The <code>try</code> expression:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">fn doAThing(str: []u8) !void {
    const number = try parseU64(str, 10);
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>
<code>try</code> evaluates an error union expression. If it is an error, it returns
from the current function with the same error. Otherwise, the expression results in
the unwrapped value.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe you know with complete certainty that an expression will never be an error.
  In this case you can do this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">const number = parseU64("1234", 10) catch unreachable;</code></pre>
<p>
Here we know for sure that "1234" will parse successfully. So we put the
<code>unreachable</code> keyword on the right hand side. <code>unreachable</code> generates
a panic in debug mode and undefined behavior in release mode. So, while we're debugging the
application, if there <em>was</em> a surprise error here, the application would crash
appropriately.
</p>
<p>There is no syntactic shortcut for <code>catch unreachable</code>. This encourages programmers
to think carefully before using it.</p>
<p>
Finally, you may want to take a different action for every situation. For that, we have
<code>if</code> combined with <code>switch</code>:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">fn doAThing(str: []u8) {
    if (parseU64(str, 10)) |number| {
        doSomethingWithNumber(number);
    } else |err| switch (err) {
        error.Overflow =&gt; {
            // handle overflow...
        },
        // we promise that InvalidChar won't happen (or crash in debug mode if it does)
        error.InvalidChar =&gt; unreachable,
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>
The important thing to note here is that if <code>parseU64</code> is modified to return a different
set of errors, Zig will emit compile errors for handling impossible error codes, and for not handling
possible error codes.
</p>
<p>
The other component to error handling is defer statements.
In addition to an unconditional <code>defer</code>, Zig has <code>errdefer</code>,
which evaluates the deferred expression on block exit path if and only if
the function returned with an error from the block.
</p>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">fn createFoo(param: i32) !Foo {
    const foo = try tryToAllocateFoo();
    // now we have allocated foo. we need to free it if the function fails.
    // but we want to return it if the function succeeds.
    errdefer deallocateFoo(foo);

    const tmp_buf = allocateTmpBuffer() orelse return error.OutOfMemory;
    // tmp_buf is truly a temporary resource, and we for sure want to clean it up
    // before this block leaves scope
    defer deallocateTmpBuffer(tmp_buf);

    if (param &gt; 1337) return error.InvalidParam;

    // here the errdefer will not run since we're returning success from the function.
    // but the defer will run!
    return foo;
}</code></pre>
<p>
The neat thing about this is that you get robust error handling without
the verbosity and cognitive overhead of trying to make sure every exit path
is covered. The deallocation code is always directly following the allocation code.
</p>
<p>
A couple of other tidbits about error handling:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>These primitives give enough expressiveness that it's completely practical
      that failing to check for an error is a compile error. If you really want
      to ignore the error, you can use <code>catch unreachable</code> and
      get the added benefit of crashing in debug mode if your assumption was wrong.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since Zig understands error types, it can pre-weight branches in favor of
    errors not occuring. Just a small optimization benefit that is not available
    in other languages.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are no C++ style exceptions or stack unwinding or anything fancy like that.
    Zig simply makes it convenient to pass error codes around.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stdlib">Alternate Standard Library</h3>
<p>
Part of the Zig project is providing an alternative to libc.
</p>
<p>
libc has a lot of useful stuff in it, but it also has
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/1998-12/msg00083.html">cruft</a>.
Since we're starting fresh here, we can create a new API without some
of the mistakes of the 70s still haunting us, and with our 20-20 hindsight.
</p>
<p>
Further, calling dynamically linked functions is
<a href="http://ewontfix.com/18/">slow</a>. Zig's philosophy is that compiling
against the standard library in source form is worth it. In C this would be
called Link Time Optimization - where you generate Intermediate Representation
instead of machine code and then do another compile step at link time. In Zig,
we skip the middle man, and create a single compilation unit with everything
in it, then run the optimizations.
</p>
<p>
So, you can choose to link against libc and take advantage of it, or you can
choose to ignore it and use the Zig standard library instead. Note, however,
that virtually every C library you depend on probably also depends on libc, which
drags libc as a dependency into your project. Using libc is still a first
class use case for Zig.
</p>
<h3 id="preprocessor-alternatives">Alternatives to the Preprocessor</h3>
<p>
The C preprocessor is extremely powerful. Maybe a little <em>too</em> powerful.
</p>
<p>
The problem with the preprocessor is that it turns one language into
two languages that don't know about each other.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples of where the preprocessor messes things up:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The compiler cannot catch even simple syntax errors in code that is
    excluded via <code>#ifdef</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    IDEs cannot implement a function, variable, or field renaming feature that
    works correctly. Among other mistakes, it will miss renaming things that are
    in code excluded via <code>#ifdef</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preprocessor defines do not show up in debug symbols by default.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>#include</code> is the single biggest contributor to slow compile times in both C and C++.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preprocessor defines are problematic for bindings generators for other languages.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Regardless of the flaws, C programmers find ourselves using the preprocessor
because it provides necessary features, such as conditional compilation,
a constant that can be used for array sizes, and generics.
</p>
<p>
Zig plans to provide better alternatives to solve these problems. For example,
the constant expression evaluator of Zig allows you to do this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">const array_len = 10 * 2 + 1;
const Foo = struct {
    array: [array_len]i32,
};</code></pre>
<p>
This is not an amazing concept, but it eliminates one use case for <code>#define</code>.
</p>
<p>
Next, conditional compilation. In Zig, compilation variables are available
via <code>@import("builtin")</code>.
</p>
<p>
The declarations available in this import evaluate to constant expressions.
You can write normal code using these constants:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">const builtin = @import("builtin");
fn doSomething() {
    if (builtin.mode == builtin.Mode.ReleaseFast) {
        // do the release behavior
    } else {
        // do the debug behavior
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>
This is
<a href="zig-programming-language-blurs-line-compile-time-run-time.html">guaranteed to leave out the if statement when the code is generated</a>.
</p>
<p>
One use case for conditional compilation is demonstrated in
<a href="http://libsound.io/">libsoundio</a>:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static const enum SoundIoBackend available_backends[] = {
#ifdef SOUNDIO_HAVE_JACK
    SoundIoBackendJack,
#endif
#ifdef SOUNDIO_HAVE_PULSEAUDIO
    SoundIoBackendPulseAudio,
#endif
#ifdef SOUNDIO_HAVE_ALSA
    SoundIoBackendAlsa,
#endif
#ifdef SOUNDIO_HAVE_COREAUDIO
    SoundIoBackendCoreAudio,
#endif
#ifdef SOUNDIO_HAVE_WASAPI
    SoundIoBackendWasapi,
#endif
    SoundIoBackendDummy,
};</code></pre>
<p>
Here, we want a statically sized array to have different contents depending on
whether we have certain libraries present.
</p>
<p>
In Zig, it would look something like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-zig">const opts = @import("build_options");
const available_backends =
    (if (opts.have_jack)
        []SoundIoBackend{SoundIoBackend.Jack}
    else
        []SoundIoBackend{})
    ++
    (if (opts.have_pulse_audio)
        []SoundIoBackend{SoundIoBackend.PulseAudio}
    else
        []SoundIoBackend{})
    ++
    (if (opts.have_alsa)
        []SoundIoBackend{SoundIoBackend.Alsa}
    else
        []SoundIoBackend{})
    ++
    (if (opts.have_core_audio)
        []SoundIoBackend{SoundIoBackend.CoreAudio}
    else
        []SoundIoBackend{})
    ++
    (if (opts.have_wasapi)
        []SoundIoBackend{SoundIoBackend.Wasapi}
    else
        []SoundIoBackend{})
    ++
    []SoundIoBackend{SoundIoBackend.Dummy};
</code></pre>
<p>
Here we take advantage of the compile-time array concatenation operator, <code>++</code>.
It's a bit more verbose than the C equivalent, but the important thing is that it's
one language, not two.
</p>
<p>
Finally, generics.
<a href="zig-programming-language-blurs-line-compile-time-run-time.html">Zig implements generics by allowing programmers to mark
parameters to functions as known at compile-time</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="tetris">Milestone: Tetris Implemented in Zig</h2>
<p>
This past week I achieved a fun milestone: a fully playable Tetris clone
implemented in Zig, with the help of libc,
<a href="http://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a>, and
<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">libpng</a>.

<h1>Do Not Use bodyParser with Express.js</h1>
<p>
I came across
<a href="https://plus.google.com/106706438172517329683/posts/4kQiD8L1D36">this Google+ post</a>
mentioning
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14612143/node-js-express-framework-security-issues">this StackOverflow post</a>
in which someone is quite wisely asking whether the
<a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js framework</a> is secure
enough to use for production applications.
</p>
<p>
This reminds me of one vulnerability in particular that I've been trying to get solved
but <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/">the maintainer</a> of express is too busy
to care. Rightfully so. I mean if you look at how much stuff this guy has to maintain it's
amazing that he's able to get around to as many issues as he does.
I just wish he'd recruit some trusted additional maintainers to keep the issue counts
from getting out of hand.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, all servers using
<a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#bodyParser">express.bodyParser</a>
are vulnerable to an attack which creates an unlimited number of temp files
on the server, potentially filling up all the disk space, which is likely
to cause the server to hang.
</p>
<h2>Demonstration</h2>
<p>
This problem is extremely easy to demonstrate. Here's a simple express app:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.use(express.bodyParser());
app.post('/test', function(req, resp) {
  resp.send('ok');
});

app.listen(9001);</code>
</pre>
<p>
Seems pretty innocuous right?
</p>
<p>
Now check how many temp files you have with something like this:
</p>
<pre>
$ ls /tmp | wc -l
33
</pre>
<p>
Next simulate uploading a multipart form:
</p>
<pre>
$ curl -X POST -F foo=@tmp/somefile.c http://localhost:9001/test
ok
</pre>
<p>
Go back and check our temp file count:
</p>
<pre>
$ ls /tmp | wc -l
34
</pre>
<p>
That's a problem.
</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<h3>Always delete the temp files when you use bodyParser or multipart middleware</h3>
<p>
  You can prevent this attack by always checking whether <code>req.files</code>
  is present for endpoints in which you use
  <code>bodyParser</code> or <code>multipart</code>, and then
  deleting the temp files. Note that this
  is <em>every endpoint</em> if you did something like
  <code>app.use(express.bodyParser())</code>.
</p>
<p>
This is suboptimal for several reasons:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>It is too easy to forget to do these checks.</li>
  <li>It requires a bunch of ugly cleanup code. Why have code when you could not have code?</li>
  <li>Your server is still, for every POST endpoint that you use bodyParser, processing
    every multipart upload that comes its way, creating a temp file, writing it to disk,
    and then deleting the temp file. Why do all that when you don't want to accept uploads?
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Avoid bodyParser and explicitly use the middleware that you need</h3>
<p>
If you want to parse json in your endpoint, use <code>express.json()</code> middleware.
If you want json and urlencoded endpoint, use <code>[express.json(), express.urlencoded()]</code>
for your middleware.
If you want users to upload files to your endpoint, use <code>express.multipart()</code> and be
sure to clean up all the temp files that are created.
</p>
<p>
This still suffers from problem #3 previously mentioned.
</p>
<h3>Consider using alternatives to formidable</h3>
<p>
<code>bodyParser</code> depends on <code>multipart</code>, which depends on
<a href="https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable">formidable</a>, which
is hardcoded to send uploads to a temp directory.
</p>
<p>
Consider using an alternative, such as
<a href="https://github.com/superjoe30/node-multiparty">multiparty</a>.
In addition to solving some bugs, it gives you much more flexibility over your file
upload, most notably not creating temp files unless you want it to.
(It also is flexible enough to for example
<a href="https://github.com/superjoe30/node-multiparty/blob/master/examples/s3.js">stream an upload directly to S3</a>).
There's also a
<a href="https://github.com/superjoe30/connect-multiparty">drop-in replacement</a>
for <code>express.multipart()</code> using multiparty.

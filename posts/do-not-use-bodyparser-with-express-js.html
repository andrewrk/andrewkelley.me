I came across
<a href="https://plus.google.com/106706438172517329683/posts/4kQiD8L1D36">this Google+ post</a>
mentioning
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14612143/node-js-express-framework-security-issues">this StackOverflow post</a>
in which someone is quite wisely asking whether the
<a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js framework</a> is secure
enough to use for production applications.
</p>
<p>
This reminds me of one "gotcha" in particular that you could be bitten by if
you're not careful.
</p>
<p>
All servers using
<a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#bodyParser">express.bodyParser</a>
are vulnerable to an attack which creates an unlimited number of temp files
on the server, potentially filling up all the disk space, which is likely
to cause the server to hang.
</p>
<h2>Demonstration</h2>
<p>
This problem is extremely easy to demonstrate. Here's a simple express app:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.use(express.bodyParser());
app.post('/test', function(req, resp) {
  resp.send('ok');
});

app.listen(9001);</code>
</pre>
<p>
Seems pretty innocuous right?
</p>
<p>
Now check how many temp files you have with something like this:
</p>
<pre>
$ ls /tmp | wc -l
33
</pre>
<p>
Next simulate uploading a multipart form:
</p>
<pre>
$ curl -X POST -F foo=@tmp/somefile.c http://localhost:9001/test
ok
</pre>
<p>
Go back and check our temp file count:
</p>
<pre>
$ ls /tmp | wc -l
34
</pre>
<p>
That's a problem.
</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<h3>Always delete the temp files when you use bodyParser or multipart middleware</h3>
<p>
  You can prevent this attack by always checking whether <code>req.files</code>
  is present for endpoints in which you use
  <code>bodyParser</code> or <code>multipart</code>, and then
  deleting the temp files. Note that this
  is <em>every endpoint</em> if you did something like
  <code>app.use(express.bodyParser())</code>.
</p>
<p>
This is suboptimal for several reasons:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>It is too easy to forget to do these checks.</li>
  <li>It requires a bunch of ugly cleanup code. Why have code when you could not have code?</li>
  <li>Your server is still, for every POST endpoint that you use bodyParser, processing
    every multipart upload that comes its way, creating a temp file, writing it to disk,
    and then deleting the temp file. Why do all that when you don't want to accept uploads?
  </li>
  <li>
  As of express 3.4.0 (connect 2.9.0) bodyParser is deprecated.
  It goes without saying that deprecated things should be avoided.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Use a utility such as tmpwatch or reap</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/jfromaniello">jfromaniello</a>
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nodejs/6KOlfk5cpcM/SCJ9jZZfP-UJ">pointed out</a>
that using a utility such as
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/tmpwatch">tmpwatch</a>
can help with this issue.
The idea here is to, for example, schedule tmpwatch as a cron job.
It would remove temp files that have not been accessed in a long enough
period of time.
</p>
<p>
It's usually a good idea to do this for all servers, just in case.
But relying on this to clean up bodyParser's mess still suffers from issue #3
outlined above. Plus, server hard drives are often small, especially when you
didn't realize you were going to have temp files in the first place.
</p>
<p>
If you ran your cron job every 8 hours for instance, given a hdd with 4 GB
of free space, an attacker would need an Internet connection with
145 KB/s upload bandwidth to crash your server.

<p>
TJ pointed out that he also has a utility for this purpose called
<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/reap">reap</a>.
</p>
<h3>Avoid bodyParser and explicitly use the middleware that you need</h3>
<p>
If you want to parse json in your endpoint, use <code>express.json()</code> middleware.
If you want json and urlencoded endpoint, use <code>[express.json(), express.urlencoded()]</code>
for your middleware.
</p>
<p>
If you want users to upload files to your endpoint, you could use <code>express.multipart()</code> and be
sure to clean up all the temp files that are created.
This would still stuffer from problem #3 previously mentioned.
</p>
<h3>Use the defer option in the multipart middleware</h3>
<p>
When you create your multipart middleware, you can use the <code>defer</code>
option like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">express.multipart({defer: true})</code>
</pre>
<p>
According to the documentation:
</p>
<blockquote>
  defers processing and exposes the multiparty form object as `req.form`.<br>
  `next()` is called without waiting for the form's "end" event.<br>
  This option is useful if you need to bind to the "progress" or "part" events, for example.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
So if you do this you will use <a href="https://github.com/superjoe30/node-multiparty/blob/master/README.md#api">multiparty's API</a> assuming that <code>req.form</code>
is an instantiated <code>Form</code> instance.
</p>
<h3>Use an upload parsing module directly</h3>
<p>
<code>bodyParser</code> depends on <code>multipart</code>, which behind the
scenes uses 
<a href="https://github.com/superjoe30/node-multiparty">multiparty</a> to
parse uploads.
</p>
<p>
You can use this module directly to handle the request. In this case you can
look at 
<a href="https://github.com/superjoe30/node-multiparty/blob/master/README.md#api">multiparty's API</a>
and do the right thing.

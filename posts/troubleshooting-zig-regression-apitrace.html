<h1>Troubleshooting a Zig Regression with apitrace</h1>
<p>
The past three months I have spent rewriting <a href="http://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> internals.
</p>
<p>
Previously, the compiler looked like this:
</p>
<p>
Source → Tokenize → Abstract Syntax Tree → Semantic Analysis → LLVM Codegen → Binary
</p>
<p>
Now the compiler looks like this:
</p>
<p>
Source → Tokenize → Abstract Syntax Tree → Intermediate Representation Code →
Evaluation and Analysis → Intermediate Representation Code → LLVM Codegen → Binary
</p>
<p>
This was a significant amount of work:
</p>
<pre>
92 files changed, 22307 insertions(+), 15357 deletions(-)
</pre>
<p>
It took a while to get all 361 tests passing before I could merge back into master.
</p>
<p>
Part of my testing process is making sure this
<a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/tetris">Tetris game</a>
continues to work. Here's a screenshot of it working, from master branch:
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, after my changes to Zig, the game looked like this:
</p>
<img src="http://superjoe.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-files/troubleshooting-zig-regression-apitrace/tetris-not-working.png">
<p>
So, I ran both versions of the game with <a href="http://apitrace.github.io/">apitrace</a>.
This resulted in a handy diff:
</p>
<img src="http://superjoe.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-files/troubleshooting-zig-regression-apitrace/apitrace-diff.png">
<p>
Here, it looks like both programs are issuing the same OpenGL commands except for different values to
<code>glUniform4fv</code>. Aha! Let's go see what's going on there.
</p>
<p>
After investigating this, it turned out that the <code>glUniform4fv</code> was simply for the piece color
and since the game uses a random number for each piece, the two instances of the game started with different
pieces.
</p>
<p>
So, I made a small change to the Random Number Generator code...
</p>
<p>
Before:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-zig">fn getRandomSeed() -&gt; %u32 {
    var seed : u32 = undefined;
    const seed_bytes = (&amp;u8)(&amp;seed)[0...4];
    %return std.os.getRandomBytes(seed_bytes);
    return seed;
 }</code>
</pre>
<p>
After:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-zig">fn getRandomSeed() -&gt; %u32 {
    return 4;
 }</code>
</pre>
<p>
After
<a href="http://xkcd.com/221/">this change</a>,
the <code>glUniform4fv</code> commands were sending the same data. Therefore, the difference
<strong>must</strong> be in the "data blob" parameters sent in initialization.
</p>
<p>
This led me to scrutinize this code:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-zig">const rect_2d_vertexes = [][3]c.GLfloat {
    []c.GLfloat{0.0, 0.0, 0.0},
    []c.GLfloat{0.0, 1.0, 0.0},
    []c.GLfloat{1.0, 0.0, 0.0},
    []c.GLfloat{1.0, 1.0, 0.0},
};
c.glGenBuffers(1, &amp;sg.rect_2d_vertex_buffer);
c.glBindBuffer(c.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sg.rect_2d_vertex_buffer);
c.glBufferData(c.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 4 * 3 * @sizeOf(c.GLfloat), (&amp;c_void)(&amp;rect_2d_vertexes[0][0]), c.GL_STATIC_DRAW);</code>
</pre>
<p>
I discovered the problem was <code>&amp;rect_2d_vertexes[0][0]</code>.
The compiler noticed that <code>rect_2d_vertexes</code> was a compile-time constant and therefore
generated the 2D array data structure as static data. It therefore evaluated <code>&amp;rect_2d_vertexes[0][0]</code>
as a compile-time known expression as well.
</p>
<p>
The problem was that each element in the <code>rect_2d_vertexes</code> referenced another array.
The compile-time constant generation code emitted an independent array for the inner arrays, whereas
we are expecting the pointer to point to a 2D array that contains all the data contiguously.
</p>
<p>
So I updated the data structure of constant arrays to refer to their parents, added a test case to cover the change,
and now the tetris game works again. Huzzah!
</p>
